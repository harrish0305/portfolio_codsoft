          <p>Hi, I'm Harrish, a passionate web developer. With a background in computer science and a keen interest in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites, I strive to bring ideas to life through coding. I specialize in front-end development, crafting elegant designs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>My journey in web development began several years ago when I discovered the power of coding to transform concepts into functional websites. Since then, I have honed my skills through continuous learning and hands-on projects.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, attending tech meetups, or enjoying outdoor activities. I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest trends and techniques in web development to deliver top-notch solutions to my clients.</p>
